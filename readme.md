This code is a Python script that reads a list of host details from an input file, retrieves SSL certificate information for each host, and generates a markdown table with the certificate details. The table includes the Common Name (CN), Certificate Authority (CA) name, and expiration date of the SSL certificates for the given hosts. The script supports different types of host inputs, including HTTPS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and file URLs. It also handles direct host and port combinations. The script uses the `ssl` and `socket` modules to establish a connection and retrieve the certificate, and the `OpenSSL.crypto` module to process the certificate information. The script can be run from the command line with arguments specifying the input and output files.
